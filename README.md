# Flutter Metal Texture Video Stream

An attempt to combine a [Flutter Metal Texture Rendering Sample](https://github.com/Sakari369/FlutterMetalCubeTextureWidget) with a [minimal-overhead iOS camera Sample](https://github.com/alexstaravoitau/MetalRenderCamera). I was unsuccessful with my attempt and need to move on to preserve velocity. So I have decided to implement our application in pure Swift for iOS deployment, which was initially deferred to try to reduce the migration shock. 

If you figure out how to get it working, make a PR so that the community can use it!

## Running

Works on macOS and iOS targets.

```
flutter pub get
flutter run
